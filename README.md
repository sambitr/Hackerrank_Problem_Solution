I am adding all the solutions of the problem, which I feel needed a little bit of brain scratching, so that I can refer them when I want to revise or revisit.</br>
<b>FYI</b> - I love python, because it's smooth as silk and easy like breathing. So the solutions will be in PYTHON ONLY. 
      Also this lists out those, which were not easy for me to solve in the first instance. It might be easy peasy for you.
